## FAQ

- I encountered a `VIGEM_ERROR_BUS_NOT_FOUND` error

Try installing `vgamepad` by executing `pip install vgamepad`
If that still doesn't work then try installing https://vigem.org/Downloads/

- Website says "No Controller Connected"

Make sure the controller is not connected to the Stadia app
